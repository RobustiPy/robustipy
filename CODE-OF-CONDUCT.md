# Contributor Code of Conduct

Values guide us in our day-to-day interactions and decision-making. Our open source projects are no exception. Trust, respect, collaboration and transparency are core values we believe should live and breathe within our projects. Our community welcomes participants from around the world with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Attempting collaboration before conflict
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), [version 1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).
